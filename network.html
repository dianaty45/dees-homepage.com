            Computer networking refers to connected computing devices (such as laptops, desktops, servers, smartphones,
            and tablets) and an ever-expanding array of IoT devices (such as cameras, door locks, doorbells,
            refrigerators, audio/visual systems, thermostats, and various sensors) that communicate with one another.</p>
        <p>Specialized devices such as switches, routers, and access points form the foundation of computer networks.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Switches connect and help to internally secure computers, printers, servers, and other devices to networks in
            homes or organizations. Access points are switches that connect devices to networks without the use of cables.
        </li>
        <li>Routers connect networks to other networks and act as dispatchers. They analyze data to be sent across a network, choose the best routes for it, and send it on its way.
            Routers connect your home and business to the world and help protect information from outside security threats.

        <p>Cloud computing refers to the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software over the internet. The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service provider. Computer system resources, especially data
        storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in cloud computing.</p>

        <p>Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive, a user can save them on cloud, making it possible
            to access the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the web. The services hosted on cloud can
            be broadly divided into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and
            software-as-a-service (SaaS). Based on the deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, private, and hybrid cloud.</p>
        <center><img src="img/cloud.png" width="50%"></center>
        <p>Cloud computing can either be classified based on the deployment model or the type of service. Based on the specific deployment model,
        it can be classify cloud as public, private, and hybrid cloud. </p>
